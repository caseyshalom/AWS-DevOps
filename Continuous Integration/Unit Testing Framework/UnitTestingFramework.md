Testing frameworks are often called test automation frameworks. They define the overall system in which the test will be automated. Testing frameworks help improve the efficiency of writing tests by helping teams organize their test suites. 

Framework responsibilities include:
- Defining a format to express expectations
- Creating a mechanism to hook into a development environment to run tests
- Executing the tests
- Reporting the results
