A linter is a program that examines your code looking for syntax problems or bugs that can lead to errors when you run the code. A linter can be integrated into build automation or authoring tools. Historical linting functions have often moved into modern compilers. Modern linting tools have evolved to scan for undeclared variables, deprecated functions, spacing and formatting conventions, misuse of scope, and other potential code issues. 

Linting tools have been developed for non-compiled languages such as Python and JavaScript, as well as tools such as AWS CloudFormation. Linting tools can test for security issues early in the development process before the code is pushed.

Linting can be performed at various stages in the development process such as in the editor, during the build process, and by way of a pre-commit hook in the version control system.
