# Code standards in practice

Static code analysis can be paired with code standards as a method to ensure coding standards are followed as code is checked into the code repository. 

In a CI/CD pipeline, code is automatically analyzed by tools on each check-in to the repository and verified against the organizationâ€™s coding standards. These tools do not replace peer reviews of code but rather can be used to flag potential problems early in the development lifecycle. Developers receive immediate feedback on any issues found in their most recent code updates.
