CodeBuild allows you to view reports generated by functional or integration tests.
The reports can be in the JUnit XML or Cucumber JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. You can view metrics such as Pass Rate %, Test Run Duration, and number of Passed versus Failed/Error test cases in one location.  Builders can use any testing framework as long as the reports are generated in the standard format.
- Pass Rate %
- Test Run Duration
- Number of Passed versus Failed/Error test cases in one location

## To view test reports, you must configure the reports section of the buildspec.yml file.
1. Create a reports section in the buildspec.yml.
2. Specify the tests in the build or post_build section.03ac8d.
3. CodeBuild needs the IAM Permissions:
```sh    
    codebuild:CreateReportGroup
    codebuild:CreateReport
    codebuild:UpdateReport
    codebuild:BatchPutTestCases
```
## The following is an example of a reports section in buildspec.yml
```sh
reports:
  SurefireReports:
    files:
      - '**/*'
    base-directory: 'target/surefire-reports'
    discard-paths: no
```

## Report output
Aggregate for all tests:
- Trends
- Pass rate
- Time for the tests

For individual tests:
- Individual unit tests
- Status of tests
- Duration
- Messages from the test
- Summary
    -Overall pass or fail count
    -Pass rate
