# CodeGuru
CodeGuru is a machine learning service for automated code reviews and application performance recommendations. With CodeGuru, you can maintain a high bar of coding standards in your software development process.

CodeGuru is powered by machine learning, best practices, and lessons learned. CodeGuru uses machine learning trained against millions of code reviews and thousands of applications profiled on open-source and Amazon code projects.

CodeGuru provides actionable recommendations for fixing identified issues. It automatically inspects code for hard-to-find defects, and helps you find the most promising methods for optimization in your running application.

## Preventing new issues in your code
CodeGuru helps avoid introducing issues that are difficult to detect, reproduce, and troubleshoot. It also helps improve application performance and reliability, and reduces the time spent finding issues.

## CodeGuru components
CodeGuru is comprised of two services: CodeGuru Reviewer and CodeGuru Profiler.

## CodeGuru Reviewer
CodeGuru Reviewer runs automated code reviews for static code analysis. It uses machine learning and automated reasoning to identify critical issues and security vulnerabilities. CodeGuru Reviewer also provides actionable recommendations you can use to improve code quality.

With CodeGuru Reviewer, you can reduce the time to find difficult issues, such as:
- Race conditions
- Slow resource leaks
- Thread safety problems
- Unsanitized inputs
- Inappropriate handling of sensitive data
- Negative impacts on application performance

## CodeGuru Profiler
CodeGuru Profiler addresses performance issues in your live application by analyzing runtime data. It can find performance issues such as re-creating expensive objects, excessive serialization, using inefficient libraries, and so forth. CodeGuru Profiler also highlights your applications' most expensive lines of code by helping to understand runtime behavior and identify inefficiencies to decrease compute costs.
